# CLAUDE.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Aiden's Lego World** is a comprehensive React web application for showcasing Lego creation photos and videos. The app uses modern cloud architecture with sophisticated media management capabilities:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with mobile-first responsive design
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security for metadata and user management  
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary for photo/video hosting, optimization, and transformation
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with admin-only access model
- **Architecture**: Progressive Web App with offline resilience and cross-device sync

## Session Status (September 14, 2025 - COMPLETED)

**FINAL STATE**: ‚úÖ Critical production bug fixed and deployed to production
- **Branch**: Merged fix from `feature/fullscreen-photo-viewer` to `main` 
- **Deployment**: Auto-deployed via Vercel from main branch
- **Status**: Production site should now load without white screen errors

**COMPLETED THIS SESSION**:
‚úÖ **Critical White Screen Fix**: Added defensive checks in Home.js and PhotoGallery.js to skip creations with empty photos arrays
‚úÖ **Migration Logic Bug Fix**: Added existence check before database insertion in cloudinaryUtils.js
‚úÖ **Database Cleanup**: Removed 12 duplicate photo records (11 batch + 1 Lloyd's dragon)
‚úÖ **Database Schema Hardening**: Added unique constraints to prevent future duplicates
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified fix with simulated corrupted data locally
‚úÖ **Production Deployment**: Deployed via Vercel auto-deployment from main branch
‚úÖ **Documentation**: Added deployment process documentation for feature branches

**ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**: Migration logic bug from August 4th, 2025 caused:
- Failed uploads creating database entries with empty photos arrays (white screen)
- Migration code re-inserting existing creations without duplicate checks (database duplicates)

**PREVENTION MEASURES ACTIVE**:
- Defensive rendering prevents crashes on corrupted data
- Migration logic now checks for existing records before insertion
- Database unique constraints prevent duplicate photo records
- Comprehensive audit system tracks all database changes

## Recent Major Features (Latest Updates)

- **CRUD Operations**: `addMediaToCreation()` and `deleteMediaFromCreation()` functions
- **Cache Sync**: Comprehensive localStorage and database synchronization

## Common Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm start` (typically runs on port 3002)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Run tests**: `npm test`
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`

## Deployment Process

### Vercel Auto-Deployment Configuration
This project uses **Vercel** with automatic deployment configured to watch the `main` branch. Changes pushed to `main` trigger automatic builds and deployments to production.

### Deploying from Feature Branches

**Standard Feature Development Flow:**
1. Create and work on feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Commit and push feature work: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Feature branches do NOT auto-deploy** - they remain in development

**Production Deployment Process:**
```bash
# Method 1: Direct merge to main (for tested features)
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main  # Triggers Vercel auto-deployment

# Method 2: Pull Request workflow (recommended for code review)
# 1. Push feature branch to GitHub
# 2. Create PR from feature branch to main
# 3. Review and merge PR
# 4. Merged main branch triggers auto-deployment
```

### Critical Production Hotfixes
For urgent production fixes that bypass normal review:

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-name

# 2. Make critical fixes and test locally
# 3. Commit fixes
git commit -m "üö® HOTFIX: Description of critical fix"

# 4. Deploy immediately to production
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue-name
git push origin main  # Triggers immediate Vercel deployment

# 5. Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/critical-issue-name
```

### Deployment Verification
After pushing to main:
1. **Check Vercel dashboard** for deployment status
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for build and deployment completion
3. **Test production site** to verify changes deployed correctly
4. **Monitor for any deployment errors** in Vercel logs

### Branch Management Best Practices
- **`main`** - Production branch, auto-deploys to live site
- **`feature/*`** - Development branches, no auto-deployment  
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical fixes, merge directly to main
- **`fix/*`** - Bug fixes, follow standard PR workflow

### Important Notes
- **Only `main` branch triggers deployment** - feature branches are safe for development
- **Test locally before merging to main** - broken code will deploy to production
- **Hotfixes bypass review** - use only for critical production issues
- **Feature branches can be long-lived** - they don't affect production until merged

## Architecture & Key Components

### Database Schema (Supabase)
**Tables:**
- `creations`: Stores creation metadata (id, name, date_added, user_id)
- `photos`: Stores media metadata (creation_id, url, public_id, name, width, height, media_type)

**Key Functions:**
- `saveCreationToDatabase()`: Creates new creations with associated media
- `addMediaToCreation()`: Adds new media to existing creations
- `deleteMediaFromCreation()`: Removes individual media files
- `updateCreationName()`: Updates creation names
- `deleteCreationFromDatabase()`: Removes entire creations

Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled with policies for public read access and authenticated write access.

### Authentication System
- **Admin-only access**: Single admin user defined by email in `src/contexts/AuthContext.js:104`
- **Current admin email**: `melodykoh0818@gmail.com`
- **Auth context**: Provides authentication state, sign-in/up functions, and admin status
- **Access control**: Unauthenticated users can view content, only authenticated admin can create/edit/delete

### Media Upload & Storage Flow
1. **File Selection**: Multi-file upload with validation (images: 10MB, videos: 50MB)
2. **Image Compression**: Automatic compression for images via `imageUtils.js`
3. **Cloudinary Upload**: Media uploaded with creation metadata and organized in folders
4. **Database Storage**: Creation and media metadata saved to Supabase
5. **Sync Management**: Handled by `cloudinaryUtils.js` with real-time status updates
6. **Cache Sync**: localStorage maintained as backup with database sync
